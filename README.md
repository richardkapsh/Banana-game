Banana Throw Game

A simple 2D physics-based throwing game built using **C#** and **MonoGame**.  
The player's objective is to throw as many bananas as possible in the moving buckets underneath with constant throw power and basic physics.


- Features
2D projectile motion physics (gravity, velocity, angle)
Sprite rendering using MonoGame’s content pipeline
Collision detection between the banana and target
Game loop architecture with update/draw cycles
Keyboard and mouse input handling


- Tech Stack
**C#**
**MonoGame Framework**
Visual Studio


- Project Structure
`Game1.cs` – main game loop (Update/Draw logic)
`Content/` – textures and sprites


- How to Run
1. Install MonoGame + Visual Studio
2. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/richardkapsh/Banana-game

3. Change to its directory

cd Banana-game

4. Open the .csproj in Visual Studio
5. Press F5 to run

- What I learned
This was my first full game using MonoGame. It helped me learn game architecture, handling sprites, developing physics systems, detecting collisions, and game loops.
